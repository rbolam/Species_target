80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,6.2,Substitution,"Innovative efforts to reduce the quantity of horseshoe crabs required to meet the demand for the bait industry have produced some gains.  Since 1999, the fishing industry began to adopt the use of bait bags, wherein smaller portions of horseshoe crabs could be used as bait in a single conch pot, as opposed to a whole animal.    This practice has expanded along the coast and resulted in a more efficient use of horseshoe crabs as bait for the conch fishery.    
An alternative bait, which chemically mimics the horseshoe crab, has been developed and was commercially marketed for the first time in 2013 (Wakefield 2013).  Preparation of the bait by individuals is also possible via a published recipe.  The product is a result of years of research by a team of researchers from the University of Delaware (Ferrari and Targett 2003).  While the product contains horseshoe crab tissue in its formulation, the amount is small enough such that widespread use of the artificial bait would significantly reduce bait harvest.   Currently, it remains uncertain whether the fishing industry will widely adopt the artificial bait.  
"
80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,5.4.3,Sub-national level,"Increased prices for horseshoe crabs in the bait market may also be responsible for increased incidences of illegal harvest.  Charges were brought in two cases of illegal harvest in New York waters in the summer of 2013.  The amount of illegal harvest in the mid-Atlantic region is unknown, although awareness by enforcement authorities is increasing (cf NY Times, July 4 2013, p. A1)."
80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,5.4.1,International level,"Harvest for LAL production has been increasing.  International trade in LAL must be controlled to ensure levels of harvest and trade are sustainable.

Increased prices and reduced availability of horseshoe crabs in the U.S. bait trade has motivated dealers to import Asian horseshoe crab species (C. rotundicauda, T. gigas, T. tridentatus) for use as bait in the domestic conch and eel fisheries (Botton et al. 2015).  These importations are viewed as a significant threat to native Limulus populations due to possible introductions of harmful parasites and pathogens into U.S. waters (Appendix).  Also, C. rotundicauda is known to accumulate tetrodotoxin, and concerns that eel and whelk may accumulate this potentially lethal neurotoxin argue against continued importation of Asian species.  For these reasons, many individual states have implemented regulations, or initiated the regulatory processes, to prohibit possession of Asian species and their use as bait in their fisheries.  Legislation that would expand the reach of the federal government for designating non-native species as invasive or injurious and prohibiting their importation is under deliberation.  The applicable statute (Lacey Act) presently applies to various taxa, including crustaceans, but not to chelicerates.   While long-term harmful effects can result from relatively few or isolated introductions, it appears the threat posed by importation of Asian species is being addressed as expediently as possible."
80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,1.2,Resource & habitat protection,"There are no management programs specifically focused on Horseshoe Crabs along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast or in MÃ©xico. Neither are there habitat conservation programs explicitly aimed at the species. However, large portions of coastal habitats in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, including coastal lagoons where Horseshoe Crabs are common and have been reported to reproduce, are under the jurisdiction of both federal and state protected areas with different legal regimes. Although none of the management programs of these protected areas include actions to protect Horseshoe Crabs, protected area administrations pay particular attention and devote considerable efforts to the monitoring and preservation of mangrove forests.

80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,1.1,Site/area protection,"The creation, restoration, or protection of beach or nearshore habitat specifically for the benefit of Horseshoe Crab populations is not common throughout the Atlantic coast. The beach replenishment or fill activities, which occur in several states (e.g., Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts), are generally justified and pursued for protection of communities and infrastructure, particularly for beaches damaged by storm erosion. A desired result is that these projects also augment horseshoe crab spawning habitat. "
80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,3.1.2,Trade management,"An emerging threat is the importation of Asian species for use as bait in the whelk fisheries in the Mid-Atlantic region with the risk of introduction of pathogens, parasites, and non-native species (Botton et al. 2015).  Also, harvest of LAL for the global market is a growing concern.  International action is needed to prevent these threats from threatening horseshoe crab persistence."
80159830,11987,Limulus polyphemus,3.1.1,Harvest management,Continued support for science-based harvest management range-wide is required to conserve horseshoe crabs.
